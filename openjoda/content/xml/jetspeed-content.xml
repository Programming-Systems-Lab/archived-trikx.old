            XML.com just published an article about my Jetspeed project.  Positive press is a good thing :)

            <title>Alexandria now part of Apache</title>
            <link>http://java.apache.org/alexandria</link>
            <description>
            Alexandria is now officially a Java/Apache project.  The license is now APL
            and hopefully will gain significant attention from its sister projects.

            <title>Java Cross Reference (JXR) now integrated into Alexandria</title>
            <link>http://relativity.yi.org/alexandria/content/html/jxr</link>
            <description>
            Tonight I finished building out the Java Cross Reference tool into 
            Alexandria.  It works rather well.  Goes across all code and then 
            writes .html files from the Java.  It currently only does syntax 
            highlighting but the Cross Reference shouldn't be that hard.

            <title>Apache Jetspeed 1.0 ships!</title>
            <link>http://java.apache.org/jetspeed</link>
            <description>
            21 March 2000 - Jetspeed 1.0 just made it out the door. This version 
            implements many Portal features and integrates with other Java/XML Apache 
            projects such as Cocoon, Turbine, and ECS. You can get it here. Jetspeed 
            is intended to be a replacement for Enterprise portals such as Yahoo, 
            Netscape, etc.
