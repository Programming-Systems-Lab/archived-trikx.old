  <p>Hi, I'm your first XSP page ever.</p>
  
  <count/>
  
  <p>The content you are seeing in this page is provided to you
  by an XML content producer that was compiled into Java bytecode
  and executed at request time. This allows greater flexibility and
  ease of use for page programmers without any performance degradation
  since all XML parsing and such is precompiled and it's avoided at
  request time.</p>
  
  <p>Let's show some useful information with expression evaluation...</p>
  
  <request-headers/>
  
  <servlet-parameters/>
  
  <p>Enjoy XSP!</p>
